# Wytyczne Rybne
This is an Atari 8-bit game written for the competition at the Wapniak 2016 party in Warsaw.

# How to build?
You need the MADS assembler. Get it here: http://mads.atari8.info/

Clone the repository and execute the following command: `mads.exe -o:fish.xex fish.asm`

You'll see the `fish.xex` file being generated:
```
Writing object file...
7038 lines of source assembled in 3 pass
36330 bytes written to the object file
```

# How to play?
Load the `fish.xex` file into your Atari :)

Or use the great `Altirra` emulator: http://www.virtualdub.org/altirra.html

# Extras
